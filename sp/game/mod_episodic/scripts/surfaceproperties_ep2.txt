//
// thickness: If this value is present, the material is not volumetrically solid
// it means that the volume should be computed as the surface area times this
// thickness (for automatic mass).  The inside space beneath the thickness value is air.
//
// physics parameters are:
// density: this is the material density in kg / m^3 (water is 1000)
// elasticity: This is the collision elasticity (0 - 1.0, 0.01 is soft, 1.0 is hard)
// friction: this is the physical friction (0 - 1.0, 0.01 is slick, 1.0 is totally rough)
// dampening: this is the physical drag on an object when in contact with this surface (0 - x, 0 none to x a lot)
//
// !!! Do not edit the physics properties (especially density) without the proper references !!!
//`
// Sounds
// 
// stepleft: footstep sound for left foot
// stepright: footstep sound for right foot
// impactsoft: Physical impact sound when hitting soft surfaces
// impacthard: Physical impact sound when hitting hard surfaces
// scrapesmooth: Looping physics friction sound (when scraping smooth surfaces)
// scraperough: Looping physics friction sound (when scraping rough surfaces)
// bulletimpact: bullet impact sound
// gamematerial: game material index (can be a single letter or a number)
// 

// NOTE: The properties of "default" will get copied into EVERY material who does not
// 	 override them!!!
//
// "base" means to use the parameters from that material as a base.
// "base" must appear as the first key in a material
