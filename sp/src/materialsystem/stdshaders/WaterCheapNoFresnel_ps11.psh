; Perform matrix multiply to get a local normal bump.  Then
; reflect the eye vector through the normal and sample from 
; a cubic environment map.

mul r0.rgb, t3, c1				; multiply color by reflecttint
+mov_sat r0.a, v0.a				; NOTE: This is necessary since v0.a can be outside 0 - 1!
add_sat r0.a, c1.a, r0.a			; cheap water blend factor + constant blend factor
