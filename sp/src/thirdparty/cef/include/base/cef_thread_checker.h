// ThreadChecker is a helper class used to help verify that some methods of a
// class are called from the same thread. It provides identical functionality to
// base::NonThreadSafe, but it is meant to be held as a member variable, rather
// than inherited from base::NonThreadSafe.
//
// While inheriting from base::NonThreadSafe may give a clear indication about
// the thread-safety of a class, it may also lead to violations of the style
// guide with regard to multiple inheritance. The choice between having a
// ThreadChecker member and inheriting from base::NonThreadSafe should be based
// on whether:
//  - Derived classes need to know the thread they belong to, as opposed to
//    having that functionality fully encapsulated in the base class.
//  - Derived classes should be able to reassign the base class to another
//    thread, via DetachFromThread.
//
// If neither of these are true, then having a ThreadChecker member and calling
// CalledOnValidThread is the preferable solution.
//
// Example:
// class MyClass {
//  public:
//   void Foo() {
//     DCHECK(thread_checker_.CalledOnValidThread());
//     ... (do stuff) ...
//   }
//
//  private:
//   ThreadChecker thread_checker_;
// }
//
// In Release mode, CalledOnValidThread will always return true.
