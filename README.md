# Momentum Mod

Momentum Mod is a free stand-alone Source mod with Counter-Strike: Source physics
dedicated to bhop and surfing while trying to improve them and simultaneously making
it easier to access and play (offline and online) as well as being cheaper
than any other Source game you'd have to buy to play either of these game modes.

of the ideas for whatever reason)
