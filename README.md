# Momentum Mod
![buildstatus](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/momentum-mod/game?svg=true)

Momentum Mod is a free stand-alone Source mod with Counter-Strike: Source physics
dedicated to bhop and surfing while trying to improve them and simultaneously making
it easier to access and play (offline and online) as well as being cheaper
than any other Source game you'd have to buy to play either of these game modes.

## Contributing

You can find a (code focused) TO DO at [TODO.md](TODO.md), where you can see what we
plan to do next or what we have in mind (But, as it is a development list, we may skip some
of the ideas for whatever reason)
