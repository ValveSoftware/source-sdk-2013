	OVERVIEW
	========

	This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
	decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
	method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
	"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
	are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
	exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you
	have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,
	very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and
	remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
	low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment
	with various compression settings.

	This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
	compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
	processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
	For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding
	variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting
	the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.

	We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
	plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
	perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
	The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

	In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
	considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
	for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
	decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
	colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
	library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included
	"jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
	processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for
	inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

	The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
	flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
	the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
	REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
	be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
	achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

	We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
	No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
	documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.


	LEGAL ISSUES
	============

	In plain English:

	1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
	   please let us know!)
	2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
	3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
	   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
	   you've used the IJG code.

	In legalese:

	The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
	with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
	fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
	its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

	This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
	All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

	Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
	software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
	conditions:
	(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
	README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
	unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
	must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
	(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
	documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
	the Independent JPEG Group".
	(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
	full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
	NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

	These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
	not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
	acknowledge us.

	Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
	in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
	it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
	software".

	We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
	commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
	assumed by the product vendor.


	ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
	sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
	ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
	by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
	that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
	ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
	of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
	the foregoing paragraphs do.

	The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
	It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
	The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
	ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
	by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

	It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
	patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
	legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
	support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
	(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
	Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
	So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
	code.

	The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
	To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
	been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
	"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
	resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
	GIF decoders.

	We are required to state that
		"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
		CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
		CompuServe Incorporated."


	REFERENCES
	==========

	We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
	understand the innards of the JPEG software.

	The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
		Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
		Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
	(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
	applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
	handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
	available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually
	a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
	omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
	and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
	and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

	A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
	"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
	M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
	good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
	including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
	code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
	sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
	at a full implementation, you've got one here...

	The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data
	Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published
	by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.
	The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1
	and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG
	in existence, and we highly recommend it.

	The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a
	paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified
	official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;
	it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)
	In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)
	642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI
	doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of
	1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%
	shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the
	actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1
	is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
	Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
	10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
	Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
	numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

	Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,
	a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG
	currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.

	The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
	format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
	1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:
		Literature Department
		C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
		1778 McCarthy Blvd.
		Milpitas, CA 95035
		phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314
	A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at
	ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text
	version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing
	the figures.

	The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
	ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
	found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
	IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
	Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
	(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or
	from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision
	of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
	Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
	uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available
	from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.


	ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
	=================

	The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet
	address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found
	there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived
	as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have
	direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact
	help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.

	Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only
	ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.

	You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive format from
	the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or
	on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12
	"JPEG Tools".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net
	release.

	The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of
	general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is
	not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to
	Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.
	It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/
	and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers
	archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.
	If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

	RELATED SOFTWARE
	================

	Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a
	few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists
	some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to
	obtain them on Internet.

	If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free
	PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image
	files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of
	other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest
	version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous
	sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.
	Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;
	you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.

	A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,
	is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program
	is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;
	it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it
	is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,
	which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)


	FILE FORMAT WARS
	================

	Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.
	The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a
	concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own,
	creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none
	of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to
	exchange compressed files.)

	The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format
	has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has
	become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.
	We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF
	Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of
	additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely
	supported, unfortunately.

	The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.
	SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should
	be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical
	advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an
	official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear
	whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto
	standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we
	have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.
	(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)

	Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.
	We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,
	one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help
	force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't
	use a proprietary file format!


	TO DO
	=====

	The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.
	The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be
	very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary
	smoothing, "poor man's variable quantization", and other means of improving
	quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.

	In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG
	Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file
	format.

	As always, speeding things up is of great interest.

	Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.
