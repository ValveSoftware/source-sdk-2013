# alias for the PEP 8 compliant names
# Note that using the new PEP 8 compliant names facilitates substitution
# with the multiprocessing module, which doesn't provide the old
# Java inspired names.

# http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/
#        CyclicBarrier.html
# for information.
# We maintain two main states, 'filling' and 'draining' enabling the barrier
# to be cyclic.  Threads are not allowed into it until it has fully drained
# since the previous cycle.  In addition, a 'resetting' state exists which is
# similar to 'draining' except that threads leave with a BrokenBarrierError,
# and a 'broken' state in which all threads get the exception.
