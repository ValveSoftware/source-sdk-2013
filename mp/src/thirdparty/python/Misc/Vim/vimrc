" <filename>``) or, if you don't have a .vimrc file, you can just symlink to it
" (``ln -s <this file> ~/.vimrc``).  All options are protected by autocmds

" All setting are protected by 'au' ('autocmd') statements.  Only files ending

" Only basic settings needed to enforce the style guidelines are set.
" Some suggested options are listed but commented out at the end of this file.

" Number of spaces that a pre-existing tab is equal to.
" For the amount of space used for a new tab use shiftwidth.

" What to use for an indent.
" This will affect Ctrl-T and 'autoindent'.
" Python: 4 spaces
" C: tabs (pre-existing files) or 4 spaces (new files)

" - o : do not insert the comment leader when using 'o' or 'O' from command mode
" - r : do not insert the comment leader when hitting <Enter> in insert mode

" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" The following section contains suggested settings.  While in no way required
" to meet coding standards, they are helpful.

" Set the default file encoding to UTF-8: ``set encoding=utf-8``

" Puts a marker at the beginning of the file to differentiate between UTF and
" UCS encoding (WARNING: can trick shells into thinking a text file is actually
" a binary file when executing the text file): ``set bomb``

" For full syntax highlighting:
"``let python_highlight_all=1``
"``syntax on``

" Automatically indent based on file type: ``filetype indent on``
" Keep indentation level from previous line: ``set autoindent``

" Folding based on indentation: ``set foldmethod=indent``
