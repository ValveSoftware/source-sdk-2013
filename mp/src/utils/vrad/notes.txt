// CHARLIE:

DONE: just rename files from .c to .cpp in source safe so history is kept
converting files of to .cpp files -- just get stuff recompiling first
make sure all common files and external dependencies handle .cpp files
add the dispmap class
add the dispface class
get rid of patches.c or patches.cpp as the case may be

DONE: create a parallel array for visited displacement faces
change the visited array to a flag in the "bsp" ddispface_t structure
DONE: add reset visited displacement face functionality
DONE: visited neighbor flags
DONE: reset visited neighbor flags
DONE: move the radial_t structure and some of its functionality to a more global scope
DONE: create a finallightdispface
DONE: generate luxels for displacement face
DONE: fix precomplightmapoffsets to take displacement faces into account
fill in luxel data from sample data
modify the GetPhongNormal and GatherSampleLight functions to use displacement face normals at "spot"
make a lightinfo list? -- so we don't regenerate initlightinfo so many times?
